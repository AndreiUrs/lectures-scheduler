# Introduction 
This is a showcase .NET Core 2.2 Web API solution, for displaying on how service should be created using step by step commits.
If you want to see how this service evolves, you should follow from the first commit, where the service is very basic, to the last commit,
where the service is a bit more advanced and structured in a nice way with using EF.
